# Hashmark Chronicles Data Schemas

## Team Roster

`/data/team/roster.json` is an array of player objects for the current season.

```json
{
  "id": 5141378,
  "name": "Cutter Boley",
  "number": 12,
  "pos": "QB",
  "class": "FR",
  "height": "6-5",
  "weight": 220
}
```

* `id` is the **ESPN athlete id** and is required for every row.
* `name` and `pos` are required strings.
* `number`, `class`, `height`, and `weight` are optional and may be omitted when unavailable.

`/data/team/roster_plus.json` extends the same player array and includes lookup maps for debugging:

```json
{
  "players": [...],
  "byId": {
    "5141378": { "id": 5141378, "name": "Cutter Boley", "pos": "QB" }
  },
  "byName": {
    "cutter boley": { "id": 5141378, "name": "Cutter Boley", "pos": "QB" }
  },
  "meta": {
    "teamId": 96,
    "team": "Kentucky",
    "season": 2025
  }
}
```

Both roster files MUST contain numeric ESPN ids for at least 90% of rows. Builds fail when the roster size falls outside 65â€“150 players.

`/data/team/roster_meta.json` provides a lightweight manifest for the UI and validator:

```json
{
  "teamId": 96,
  "season": 2025,
  "generated_at": "2024-10-20T12:34:56.000Z",
  "source": "espn"
}
```

* `teamId` and `season` are hard locked to Kentucky's 2025 squad. Validators fail if these values drift.
* `generated_at` and `source` are informational and may reflect the last successful provider pull.

## Spotlight Datasets

All spotlight datasets live at the repo root under `/data/spotlight_*.json`.

* `spotlight_offense_last.json`
* `spotlight_defense_last.json`
* `spotlight_offense_season.json`
* `spotlight_defense_season.json`
* `spotlight_featured.json` (single object)

Each spotlight entry MUST include an ESPN id and link so the client can derive headshots and stats.

All spotlight rows must reference ids present in the locked 2025 roster; alumni and past-season entries are rejected during validation.

```json
{
  "id": 5141378,
  "name": "Cutter Boley",
  "pos": "QB",
  "espn": "https://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/5141378/cutter-boley",
  "last_game": {
    "opp": "Texas",
    "cmp_att": "31/39",
    "yds": "258",
    "td": "0",
    "int": "1"
  }
}
```

* `id` must be numeric and match an entry in the roster.
* `espn` should always be the canonical ESPN player URL; ids may be parsed from it during validation.
* At least one of `last_game` or `season` must be a non-empty object of string stats.
* Builds fail when more than 5% of spotlight ids are missing from the roster or when any entry lacks an id/link pair.

## Cache Hygiene

A successful build writes a `spotlight_history.json` metadata file and mirrors the most recent artifacts into `.cache/spotlight/last-good/`. Use `npm run validate:data` to confirm datasets before publishing.

## Offline Fixtures

Use `npm run test:fixtures` to run an offline smoke test against canned 2025 data stored in `/fixtures`. The fixtures keep CI
green when ESPN or CFBD providers are unavailable while still validating roster/spotlight consistency.
