  <h1>Kentucky vs. Texas Football Preview – Oct. 18, 2025</h1>

  <!-- Opening Context -->
  <h2>Opening Context</h2>
  <p>It’s Homecoming in Lexington, and the <strong>evolving landscape</strong> of the SEC brings a burnt-orange visitor: the <em>Texas Longhorns</em> are set to play at Kroger Field for the first time ever [Fox Sports]. This is a rare primetime matchup steeped in intrigue. Kentucky (2–3, 0–3 SEC) is desperate for a course correction after a rocky start, while No. 21 Texas (4–2, 1–1 SEC) is trying to prove it can handle success without stumbling. The stakes? For Kentucky, a chance to salvage a season and perhaps Mark Stoops’ job security; for Texas, a shot to show they can win on a cold SEC night far from home [ESPN].</p>
  <p>Last time out, Texas exorcised some Red River demons by <strong>smothering Oklahoma 23–6</strong> at the Cotton Bowl [ESPN]. Arch Manning didn’t light up the stat sheet, but the highly-touted sophomore quarterback played efficient, winning football in Dallas – converting third downs and protecting the ball when it mattered [KSR]. Now, fresh off that emotional rivalry win, the Longhorns must avoid a classic let-down scenario. History isn’t on Sark’s side here: Texas under Steve Sarkisian is 2–2 outright and 0–4 against the spread in games immediately following the Red River showdown [Sports-Reference]. In other words, the Horns often suffer a post-OU hangover, and the Wildcats hope to pour the coffee and deliver the headache.</p>
  <p>Kentucky, meanwhile, is coming off its second bye week of the year – a breather that was badly needed. The Wildcats were humbled 35–14 at Georgia in their last outing [KSR], a game where injuries and offensive stagnation reared their ugly heads. Stoops used the bye to get his team healthy and refocused [On3]. It’s been 35 days since Kentucky last played under the lights at home, and Big Blue Nation is anxious for a reason to believe. Despite a 2–3 record, the fan base remains hungry (and perhaps a little anxious) for a signature win to jolt the season back to life. There’s a sense that tonight could be special — if the Cats can seize the moment.</p>
  <p>Speaking of moments: the atmosphere in Lexington should be electric. It’s a Saturday night in the Bluegrass, Keeneland’s fall meet is in full swing by day, and by night the Kentucky faithful will pack Kroger Field hoping to witness an upset. Kentucky will even be breaking out the <strong>chrome domes</strong> – shiny silver helmets – with all-blue uniforms, while Texas arrives in their classic icy whites [UKFootball]. The Wildcats’ social media team set the tone with a cinematic uniform reveal, embracing the local horse racing flair by dubbing the look “this week’s silks” [UKFootball]. Check out the mini-teaser they dropped to get fans hyped for kickoff:</p>

  <!-- Coach’s Talk -->
  <h2>Coach’s Talk</h2>
  <p>Both head coaches have been working the narrative game this week, albeit in very different situations. Kentucky’s Mark Stoops has been in pep-talk mode – with fans, players, and maybe even himself. “We had a really good, productive bye week…got guys healthy, got a head start on Texas,” Stoops said on Monday [KSR]. He knows the noise is out there – his name even popped up in another school’s coaching search rumor mill – but Stoops is laser-focused on the here and now. “Texas is Texas. It’s a typical team. They’re very, very good at every level…good on offense, defense, special teams,” he remarked, heaping respect on the Longhorns [KSR]. Stoops has faced Sarkisian before (back when Stoops was at Arizona and Sark at USC), and he hasn’t forgotten: “I’ve always had a ton of respect for him and the way he calls plays” [On3].</p>
  <p>Stoops didn’t shy away from praising Texas’ quarterback either. “Arch is a very, very good football player. Each and every game he looks more comfortable,” Stoops noted, highlighting Manning’s ability to evade pressure and make throws on the run [KSR]. Coming from a defensive coach like Stoops, that’s genuine respect – and a hint at Kentucky’s concern if Arch gets loose outside the pocket. At the same time, Stoops expressed confidence in his own young QB, Cutter Boley, saying the freshman’s “comfort level with the offense” is growing and that the team needs to do its part in giving him time and a good game plan [KSR].</p>
  <p>On the burnt-orange sideline, Steve Sarkisian’s message has been about guarding against complacency. In the aftermath of the Oklahoma win, Sark praised his team’s maturity and specifically lauded Arch Manning for silencing the critics with a poised performance [KVUE]. But he immediately turned the page to Kentucky, emphasizing that going into a hostile environment requires a new level of focus. “We’ve got to be prepared for a war,” Sarkisian said of the Wildcats, making it clear he expects a four-quarter battle in Lexington [KVUE]. Sark knows the narrative – that his teams often stumble after the Red River game – and he’s practically dared his players to reverse that trend. In Austin, the talk all week has been about not overlooking a “sputtering but dangerous” Kentucky team [On3]. In other words, Texas is saying the right things about respecting Kentucky. Whether they truly believe the Wildcats can threaten them might be another story – one that Stoops would love to author as an upset.</p>
  <p>Both coaches also had to address the war of attrition. Stoops updated the status of a few key Wildcats during the week: star RB <strong>Seth McGowan</strong>, who got dinged up late against Georgia, is back to 100%, and a big addition – cornerback <strong>DJ Waller Jr.</strong> – returns after missing four games with a hamstring injury [KSR]. That latter news is huge for Kentucky’s secondary depth. Sarkisian, on the other hand, had to explain how Texas will cope without multiple starters. He confirmed that starting center <strong>Cole Hutson</strong> and left guard <strong>Connor Stroh</strong> are out, meaning Texas will field a shuffled offensive line on the road [On3]. Sark also acknowledged the running back room is “light.” Texas’ power back <strong>CJ Baxter</strong> is sidelined by a knee injury, and their third-string RB removed himself from the roster to preserve a redshirt [ESPN]. Publicly, Sarkisian has expressed confidence in the “next man up” – praising backup center Connor Robertson’s experience with Manning [KVUE] – but there’s no question these absences are a concern. In coach-speak, Stoops smells blood in the water, and Sark knows it.</p>

  <!-- Quarterback Analysis -->
  <h2>Quarterback Analysis</h2>
  <p>This matchup gives us a fascinating quarterback contrast: the prodigy vs. the prodigy-in-training. On one side, you have <strong>Arch Manning</strong>, a surname that carries the weight of quarterback royalty. Manning’s transition to being the full-time starter at Texas wasn’t seamless – he had his ups and downs early this season – but the young man seems to be finding his footing. His season stats are solid: <em>1,317 passing yards, 12 TDs, 5 INTs</em>, completing about 63% of his throws [ESPN]. He’s also added five rushing touchdowns, showing a sneaky-good ability to hurt teams with his legs in the red zone [ESPN]. Perhaps most importantly, Arch is fresh off his most mature outing yet: against OU he didn’t force the hero throws, instead he moved the chains on third down and avoided back-breaking mistakes. Kentucky’s defensive coordinator Brad White noted on Tuesday that Manning “can make all the throws, in rhythm and on time, or buying time” outside the pocket, echoing Stoops’ praise [KSR]. The Wildcats know they’re not just facing the hype; they’re facing a QB who’s growing up fast.</p>
  <p>On the other sideline stands <strong>Cutter Boley</strong>, Kentucky’s 18-year-old, home-grown freshman signal-caller thrust into the spotlight perhaps a bit earlier than planned. Boley, a former four-star recruit from Kentucky, has had an understandably bumpy introduction to college ball. In limited action so far, he’s thrown for <em>627 yards, 4 TDs, and 3 INTs</em>, with a completion rate just over 57% [KSR]. Those numbers won’t wow anyone nationally, but context is key: Boley didn’t even expect to be the starter this soon. Kentucky began the year with a more veteran QB, only to hand the keys to the freshman once it became clear the season needed a spark and a build for the future. Each week, Boley shows a few “wow” throws that flash his talent – a laser on a deep out here, a touch pass over a linebacker there – followed by the inevitable freshman mistakes. Stoops has kept the offense relatively conservative for him, leaning on the run and short timing routes. Still, Stoops insists the “comfort level” and leadership from Boley improves each week [KSR]. The bye week gave Cutter extra time to rep with the first team and digest the playbook. Kentucky’s hope is that a combination of home environment and a simplified game plan allows Boley to play free and loose – and maybe uncork a deep shot or two when Texas least expects it. Tonight could be the night Boley grows up, channeling the energy of Big Blue Nation to deliver a breakout performance that propels Kentucky to an upset.</p>
  <p>The key for both QBs will be how they handle pressure. Manning has generally been well-protected this season, but with two new linemen stepping in, will he get happy feet if Kentucky’s pass rush finds its way into the backfield? Arch has shown he can escape one rusher and make plays, but he also hasn’t faced a ton of adversity on the road yet. Boley, on the other hand, has been running for his life at times. In his last SEC start, at South Carolina, the protection breakdowns led to six sacks and four turnovers in one nightmare quarter [Sports-Reference]. Kentucky absolutely cannot let that happen again if they have any shot. We might see Boley use his legs on designed rollouts or even a few scrambles; he’s not known as a dual threat, but the kid is 6'5" and surprisingly mobile when he decides to tuck it. Ultimately, Manning is the more polished product right now – no shock, as one of the most touted recruits in decades – but Boley is a bit of a wild card. If he can channel the energy of the home crowd into fearless play, he might just make a name for himself in the fourth quarter. Of course, that’s a big “if.” For now, advantage at quarterback clearly lies with Texas and Arch Manning’s pedigree and production—but Boley’s potential to step up could flip the script for a Kentucky victory.</p>

  <!-- Trench Warfare -->
  <h2>Trench Warfare: The Big Uglies Battle</h2>
  <p>As with most SEC clashes, this game could be won or lost in the trenches. And in this department, both teams come in with something to prove – and something to exploit. Let’s start with when <strong>Texas has the ball</strong>. The Longhorns’ offensive line was supposed to be a question mark entering 2025. They needed four new starters and, notably, did not bring in any transfers to plug holes [On3]. For a while, it looked like OL coach Kyle Flood’s development plan was shaky – Texas struggled to get a consistent push up front in several early games. Now injuries have made things even dicier. With center Cole Hutson and guard Connor Stroh out, Texas will roll with backups in a loud road environment. Kentucky’s defensive line must be licking their chops. This unit has quietly been the strength of the Wildcats’ defense all season – solid against the run and occasionally disruptive rushing the passer [KSR]. UK added a 300-pound plug in Wazzu transfer <strong>David Gusta</strong> specifically for nights like this [On3], to push the pocket and eat double-teams. Expect Gusta and senior DT <strong>Josaih Hayes</strong> to test that new Texas center with some bull rushes and stunts early on.</p>
  <p>Moreover, Kentucky’s edge rush, which has been underwhelming so far, gets a potential boost with the return of cornerback DJ Waller (which could allow more blitzing confidence outside) [KSR]. Don’t be surprised if coordinator Brad White draws up a few creative pressures – perhaps bringing linebackers <strong>D’Eryk Jackson</strong> or <strong>Jamon Dumas-Johnson</strong> through the A-gaps – to confuse Texas’ protection calls. The Wildcats know they need to affect Arch Manning’s timing. The blueprint was shown by Florida in Texas’s other loss: the Gators brought a downhill, physical attack that harassed Manning and clogged running lanes, holding Texas to just 13 points in that game. “Florida had some success with a downhill run game against Texas,” KSR’s film breakdown noted [KSR], which allowed the Gators to control the clock. Kentucky’s defense will aim to replicate that physicality. If they can slow Texas’ run game without having to dedicate extra men in the box, they can then mix up coverages and make Manning uncomfortable.</p>
  <p>The flip side is when <strong>Kentucky has the ball</strong>, and this is a heavyweight fight worth watching: Kentucky’s much-improved offensive line versus Texas’s ferocious defensive front. Let’s acknowledge the progress first – last year, the Big Blue Wall was a turnstile. This year, after a portal rebuild, the unit has taken a big step forward [KSR]. The interior trio (guard-center-guard) has been rock solid in pass pro, allowing only a handful of pressures through five games [On3]. The tackles, however, remain a bit of an adventure. New left tackle <strong>Shiyazh “Zy” Pete</strong> and right tackle <strong>Alex Wollschlaeger</strong> have athleticism and size, but they’ve collectively allowed 27 pressures off the edge already [Sports-Reference]. When Kentucky’s protection breaks down, it’s usually around the corner. And wouldn’t you know it – Texas’s best pass rushers live on the edge.</p>
  <p><strong>Colin Simmons</strong>, Texas’s true freshman phenom, has been every bit as good as advertised. He’s registered 4 sacks and 5 tackles for loss, with a team-high 18 pressures in six games [ESPN]. Simmons is the kind of speed rusher that gave Kentucky fits earlier this year (South Carolina’s similar edge rushers racked up 6 sacks against UK in Week 5 [Sports-Reference]). Opposite Simmons, Texas has a rotation including <strong>Justice Finkley</strong> and Arkansas transfer <strong>Brad Spence</strong> (2 sacks in limited snaps) [On3], and even veteran <strong>Trey Moore</strong>, who has 28.5 career sacks (a transfer from UTSA) [ESPN]. It’s a deep, nasty group. Kentucky’s O-line simply must play its best game of the season. O-line coach Zach Yenser likely spent the bye week drilling pass protection fundamentals and maybe scheming up extra help – expect a tight end or running back to chip on Simmons almost every passing down. If Pete and Wollschlaeger can’t hold up one-on-one, Kentucky will have no choice but to keep extra blockers in, which of course limits the passing attack. Watch early downs: if Kentucky falls into obvious passing situations and Texas can unleash the hounds, it could get ugly. But if Kentucky can stay “ahead of the sticks” and thus keep the play-action and quick passing game in play, they have a fighting chance to neutralize that Texas pass rush.</p>

  <!-- X-Factor card -->
  <div class="xfactor">
    <h3>X-Factor: Cam Miller (WR, Fr.)</h3>
    <p>If <strong>Bush Hamdan</strong> actually dials up touches, Miller changes the geometry of the field. He’s Kentucky’s most trustworthy hands catcher right now—snags outside his frame, settles in space, and turns routine throws into on-schedule gains. Give him 6–8 designed opportunities (quick RPO glance, boundary hitch, slot fade, and one schemed deep post) and the offense gets rhythm without gambling the farm.</p>
    <small>Why it matters tonight: reliable hands on early downs keep Boley in phase and slow Texas’s edge heat.</small>

  <!-- Keys for Kentucky -->
  <h2>Keys for Kentucky: Offense & Defense</h2>
  <h3>When Kentucky Has the Ball (Offensive Keys)</h3>
  <p><strong>Establish the Run – and Don’t Abandon It:</strong> This cannot be overstated. Kentucky’s best offensive weapon is running back <strong>Seth McGowan</strong>, a transfer from New Mexico State who has been a revelation. McGowan has racked up 431 yards and 7 touchdowns already, averaging 5.5 yards per carry [ESPN]. He’s a tough, one-cut runner with sneaky burst through the hole. In Kentucky’s near-upset of Georgia last month, the Wildcats pounded out over 200 rushing yards by sticking with the ground game even when it wasn’t flashy [KSR]. They’ll need a similar commitment tonight. Texas’s defense has been nearly impenetrable on paper – just 11.0 points allowed per game (3rd nationally) [ESPN] – but they did show a crack against Florida. The Gators ran right at Texas’s front, controlled time of possession, and never let the Longhorns dictate tempo. Offensive coordinator Bush Hamdan will likely script the first drive to feature plenty of McGowan, maybe some wildcat formation or end-arounds to mix it up, but the theme is simple: <em>be physical and win first down</em>. If McGowan can churn out 4-5 yards consistently on early downs, Kentucky can avoid the doomed scenario of third-and-long vs. Texas’s pass rush.</p>
  <p><strong>Protect the Football:</strong> Kentucky does not have the firepower to survive turnovers in this game – period. The Wildcats are a woeful -2 in turnover margin on the year, while Texas is +6 (second-best in the SEC) [Sports-Reference]. That stark difference is a big reason the Longhorns are favored by nearly two touchdowns. In Kentucky’s last SEC home night game (vs. South Carolina), a cascade of turnovers – including two defensive scores by the opponent in the span of 30 seconds – turned a close game into a blowout loss. As Stoops bluntly put it after that one, “this team can’t overcome that” [KSR]. So Kentucky must play clean. That means Boley needs to be judicious with his throws – it’s okay to throw it away or check down and punt. The receivers and running backs need to secure the ball through contact; Texas defenders like DB <strong>Michael Taaffe</strong> (who has an INT and a knack for stripping ballcarriers) will be looking to rip it out [ESPN]. Kentucky’s margin for error is slim, so they can’t give Texas a short field. If they finish +1 or better in turnovers, they’ll greatly increase their upset chances.</p>
  <p><strong>Hit a Deep Shot:</strong> This might sound counterintuitive given the last point, but Kentucky will likely need at least one explosive play from the passing game. Texas’s defense is too good to be beaten purely by 12-play, 75-yard drives. At some point, a Texas safety or corner will be squatting on the run, and that’s when Boley has to strike. Watch for play-action on first down around midfield – Offensive Coordinator Bush Hamdan may dial up a deep post to <strong>Cam Miller</strong> (true freshman X-factor with real hands) or <strong>attack the edges with Kendrick Law</strong> to catch Texas napping. In six games, Texas has allowed few big plays, but they haven’t been flawless; their secondary ranks middle-of-the-pack nationally in explosive pass plays allowed. The likely matchup to target is opposite Texas’s star corner <strong>Malik Muhammad</strong>—take the clean one-on-one when it appears. If Kentucky hits one long touchdown through the air, it could flip this game on its head and ignite the crowd. But they must choose their moment wisely – a turnover while getting greedy would be devastating. It’s a calculated risk they have to take at least once.</p>

  <h3>When Texas Has the Ball (Defensive Keys)</h3>
  <p><strong>Pressure Arch Manning Early and Often:</strong> This game plan starts with making Arch uncomfortable. Kentucky’s defense has a mere 10 sacks in five games – not exactly a terrifying number. But as discussed, Texas’s O-line has vulnerabilities right now. Coordinator Brad White may need to dial up blitzes he normally wouldn’t. The risk of blitzing Manning is leaving Texas’s playmakers one-on-one, but the risk of not blitzing is giving Arch time to pick apart a defense that’s struggled in coverage at times. Kentucky gets corner DJ Waller Jr. back in the lineup, which is a boost to their secondary depth [KSR]. That might embolden White to send an extra rusher. We could see Kentucky bring five or even six rushers on third downs, something they’ve done sparingly this season. The first quarter will be telling: if Kentucky can hit Manning a couple of times, even if it’s just forcing throwaways, it could affect his internal clock. Conversely, if Arch has a clean pocket from the get-go, he’ll settle in and could methodically carve Kentucky up. Kentucky’s defense doesn’t necessarily need sacks, but they need to <em>harass</em> – get hands in passing lanes, collapse the pocket, and make Arch move his feet. A hurried throw can turn into a turnover, and a turnover can change the complexion of the game.</p>
  <p><strong>Sell Out to Stop the Run on Early Downs:</strong> Texas has a reputation as a passing team with Sarkisian and now Arch, but the quiet backbone of their offense is a power run game. Even without CJ Baxter, the Longhorns have a committee of backs like <strong>Quintrevion “Tre” Wisner</strong> (a speedy sophomore) and <strong>Jaydon Blue</strong> who can hurt you if you let them get downhill. Kentucky’s run defense has been solid, allowing under 4 yards per carry to opposing running backs this year. The blueprint for Kentucky should resemble what they did in their 2021 upsets – load the box, trust the secondary, and make the opponent one-dimensional. Texas averages a modest 28.5 points per game [ESPN], which suggests they aren’t an offensive juggernaut but rather a team that capitalizes on short fields and defensive dominance. If Kentucky stuffs the run on first and second down, they’ll force Texas into third-and-long, where Kentucky’s defensive line can tee off and exotic coverages can be deployed. With Baxter unavailable, in 3rd-and-2 type scenarios Kentucky might have an edge if they win at the line. Watch the interior rotation—<strong>Josaih Hayes</strong> and <strong>David Gusta</strong>—to be potential game-wreckers inside. If they can stonewall the Texas inside zone and counter plays early, Texas may become pass-happy. And as good as Arch is, a one-dimensional Texas offense is exactly what Kentucky wants to see.</p>
  <p><strong>Tackle in Space, Limit YAC:</strong> Perhaps the most improved aspect of Texas’s team this year is their ability to turn short throws into big gains. Freshman receiver <strong>Ryan Wingo</strong> (22 catches, 298 yards) and fellow wideout <strong>Parker Livingstone</strong> (308 yards, 3 TDs) aren’t household names yet, but they’re dynamic in space [ESPN]. Texas will test Kentucky’s tackling with quick screens, swing passes, and crossing routes – the kind of plays that have haunted the Cats’ defense in some of their losses. Stoops himself noted that Texas’s players are “very good tacklers in space” on defense [KSR]; Kentucky’s defenders need to return the favor. Too often in the Georgia loss, Kentucky missed a tackle that turned a 5-yard gain into a 20-yard gain. That can’t happen tonight. Look for Kentucky to deploy a lot of zone coverage to keep eyes on the ball and rally to tackles. Safeties <strong>Jordan Lovett</strong> and <strong>Kristian Story</strong> (the veteran) will be critical as the last line of defense – they must take good angles when Arch checks down or hits a slant. If Kentucky can force Texas to actually drive the field without explosive plays, there’s a chance the young Longhorn offense will make a mistake or stall out. Bend-but-don’t-break only works if you tackle well.</p>

  <!-- Special Teams Spotlight -->
  <h2>Special Teams Spotlight</h2>
  <p>In a game projected to be a defensive slog, special teams could be the difference-maker. Kentucky’s kicking game, led by <strong>Alex Raynor</strong>, has been reliable, with an 88% field goal rate (8/9, long of 48 yards) [ESPN]. Raynor’s consistency in clutch moments—like a 46-yard make vs. Georgia—could be vital if the game comes down to a late kick. However, Kentucky’s punt return unit ranks 75th nationally (7.2 yards per return), struggling to flip field position [Sports-Reference].</p>
  <p>Texas counters with kicker <strong>Bert Auburn</strong>, who’s 10/12 on field goals (83%, long of 51 yards) [ESPN]. Auburn’s range gives Texas an edge in long-distance situations, but their kickoff coverage has been shaky, allowing 22.1 yards per return (89th nationally) [Sports-Reference]. <strong>Update for 2025:</strong> Kentucky’s return units feature <strong>Ty Bryant</strong> as the primary punt returner (with <strong>Troy Stellato</strong> listed as an option) and <strong>Kendrick Law</strong> as the top kickoff returner. If Texas’s coverage units leave creases, Law’s acceleration can tilt hidden yardage toward the Cats.</p>
  <p><strong>Key Battle:</strong> Field position. Kentucky’s punter averages 42.3 yards per punt (60th), while Texas’s is 44.1 (38th) [ESPN]. If Kentucky’s defense forces three-and-outs, poor punting could give Texas short fields. Conversely, a big return by the Cats could set up Kentucky’s offense for a short-field score, critical given their 93rd-ranked offense (346.7 YPG) [Sports-Reference]. The team that wins the hidden yards on special teams may tilt this close game.</p>

  <!-- Prediction -->
  <h2>Prediction</h2>
  <p>The oddsmakers and virtually every pundit are siding with Texas, and it’s hard to blame them. On paper, the Longhorns have the superior talent, the gaudier ranking, and that stifling defense that’s allowed barely a trickle of points all year [ESPN]. Texas is favored by 12.5 points, and a computer model’s implied score is roughly 28–16 in Texas’s favor [Fox Sports]. But games aren’t won on paper, especially not on cool October nights in Lexington. There’s a reason we get a little weird in the Bluegrass after dark. This one has the feel of a slog, a defensive slugfest where one big mistake or one big play could turn the tide.</p>
  <p>I expect Kentucky to come out swinging, catching Texas off guard early with their intensity. The Wildcats might even build a lead in the first half, say 13–7, with a combination of a long McGowan touchdown drive and a field goal after a Texas turnover. Arch Manning and the Longhorns will respond – they’re too well-coached and composed not to. As the game wears on, Texas’s defensive front could start asserting itself, but Kentucky’s offense, powered by a maturing Boley, may find its rhythm. I foresee a critical sequence in the second half: Texas pulling ahead by a field goal, but Boley orchestrating a drive in the fourth quarter, hitting a deep shot to <strong>Cam Miller</strong> for the go-ahead touchdown. Texas, down 20–17 in the final minutes, will have a chance – the ball in Manning’s hands – but a late interception by Kentucky (fitting, given their opportunistic defense at home) seals the upset.</p>
  <p><strong>Final Score: Kentucky 23, Texas 20.</strong> The Wildcats cover the spread and pull off the upset, with Boley growing up before our eyes and delivering a signature performance. It’ll be a valiant effort by Texas – but Kentucky makes one or two more big plays to secure the win in Lexington. This could be the program-changing upset the BBN has been waiting for, cooling the talk around Stoops’ seat and igniting the season. Don’t be surprised if we’re all celebrating in the final five minutes. As Stoops might say, the Cats seize the moment – and a war they shall win. Such is the magic of SEC nights in the Bluegrass.</p>
  <p><em>(Now go enjoy the game, and remember: no matter what happens, the bourbon in Lexington will still be top-shelf and the sun will rise tomorrow. Go Cats.)</em></p>
